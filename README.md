### About
In some cases, during the process registration, cannot design through social networks like e-wallets, bank accounts, etc. In such cases, usually, in applications, for ease of use, developed a particular form for a phone number with a pre-selected country code and convenient number entry. But exist the case when users also should be able to sign up by e-mail. For such an example, we have designed the unique **cellular number mask** that appears when the user starts typing numbers.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.2+
- Xcode 11+
- Swift 5.0+

## Example
First clone the repo, and run `carthage update` from the root directory.
The example application is the best way to see `EKFieldMask` in action. Simply open the `EKFieldMask.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

EKLayout is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'EKFieldMask'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate `EKFieldMask` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "ekamalov/EKFieldMask"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `EKFieldMask.framework` into your Xcode project.

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate `EKFieldMask` into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

After installing the lib and importing the module `EKFieldMask`, the text field can be used like any other text field.

```swift
/// Public initializer
/// - Parameter title: TipView title
/// - Parameter placeholder: text field placeholder
/// - Parameter preferences: global perference
public init(tipView title: String = "Tap again to clear",
			placeholder: String,
			preferences: Preferences = EKFieldMask.staticGlobalPreferences)

/// Example
let maskField: EKFieldMask = EKFieldMask(placeholder: "E-mail or phone number")
//or     
let maskField: EKFieldMask = EKFieldMask(tipView: "Tap again to clear",
 					 placeholder: "E-mail or phone number")

```
If you want to change the appearance look `Customizing` heading

```swift
/// Example
var preferences = EKFieldPreferences()
preferences.tipView.body.backgroundColor = .red
preferences.textField.textColor = .blue
preferences.countryView.tableView.cell.countryTextColor = .black

let field = EKFieldMask(tipView: "Tap again to clear",
                                placeholder: "E-mail or phone number",
                                preferences: preferences)
```

## Customizing

In order to customize the `EKFieldMask` appearance and behavior, you can play with the `Preferences` structure which encapsulates all the customizable properties. These preferences have been split into three structures:

public var borderWidth: CGFloat      = 1

/// Use the sectionTitleColor property to change the color of the tableView section title color. By default, uses black with alpha 0.4
public var borderColor: UIColor      = UIColor.black.withAlphaComponent(0.1)

/// Use the cornerRadius property to change the corner radius of the field  . By default, uses 10px
public var cornerRadius: CGFloat     = 10

/// Use the leftIcon property to change the search icon of the search field in countriesViewController  . By default, uses search icon
public var leftIcon: UIImage?        = UIImage(named: "search", in: Bundle.resource, compatibleWith: nil) ?? nil

public var clearButtonIcon: UIImage? = UIImage.init(named: "clear", in: .resource, compatibleWith: nil) ?? nil

/// The text font. By default bold system font with size 18
public var font: UIFont              = UIFont(name: "Gilroy-SemiBold", size: 18) ?? .boldSystemFont(ofSize: 18)

/// Use the tintColor property to change the color of the field tint . By default, uses black
public var tintColor: UIColor        = .black

/// Use the textColor property to change the  color of the text. By default, uses black

```
### Country View Controller
